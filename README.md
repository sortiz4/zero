# Zero
Zero is a fast, simple, single-pass command-line utility that securely erases
files by zero-filling them. It's non-recursive and non-verbose by default, and
always prompts the user before descending into absolute paths.

## Usage
Zero expects one or more files

```
$ zero [OPTIONS] [PATHS]
```
