# Zero
Zero is a fast, simple, single-pass command line tool that securely erases
files by zero-filling them. It's non-recursive and non-verbose by default, and
always prompts the user before descending into absolute paths.

## Usage
Zero expects one or more paths. All files in directories will be overwritten.

```
$ zero [PATHS]
```
